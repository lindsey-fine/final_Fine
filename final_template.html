			<p>Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, most colleges and universities created dashboards where they post information about how COVID-19 is spreading on their campuses. Numbers have fluctuated as new variants infected people and other factors like travel and weather. This data project aims to see how much the COVID-19 numbers for Big Ten Conference Schools have fluctuated and if the universities had peaks and dips during similar times in 2020. It also looks to see if the amount of tests a school performed correlated with how many confirmed positive cases the school had.</p>

			<p>In March 2020, colleges and universities across the country shut down because of the COVID-19 pandemic. They then had to learn how to adapt to a new normal. Schools had to learn how to perform mass COVID-19 testing and how to handle students and faculty testing “positive.” 
Many universities created a COVID-19 dashboard to keep their community informed about the latest information with COVID-19 positive cases on campus, using tests and positive cases to determine how “bad” or “good” the community’s COVID-19 situation was at the time.  David Larsen, a Syracuse University associate professor of public health, said positive cases can be a misleading number because of different factors including how many people are getting tested.
“Cases are kind of tricky as a metric because they are so dependent on test availability and test-taking behavior and symptoms,” Larsen said. 
 	Some dashboards include latest trends, positivity rate, the number of people in quarantine and the amount of COVID-19 tests the university administered. Some universities only provided the number of positive cases and nothing else. The BIG TEN school with the lowest reported positivity rate was University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with 0.49% of the tests taken on campus being positive and the school with the highest positivity rate was Michigan State University with 33.67% positivity rate. Larsen said some universities could skew their COVID-19 positivity rate through administering random testing and including those tests in the metric. 
“Test positivity is a metric that is a little bit robust to issues with test seeking behavior, but the test positivity is often misinterpreted,” Larsen said. “If people are doing random surveillance, like random testing or mass testing, then they use those negative tests to decrease their test positivity. It is not how that metric is defined, it is actually the percentage of people who seek testing and are positive.”

			<p>Larsen said those worried about looking at skewed data should be able to turn to university’s COVID-19 dashboards.  
“Institutions should be reporting how those metrics are calculated, and most institutions have a dashboard, and I would hope that those dashboards have definitions for how they calculated their metrics,” Larsen said. 
Larsen also said it is hard to compare schools against each other because they have different testing and surveillance strategies as well as different cultures around testing and vaccination in their surrounding cities. 
“If you have different institutions with different testing policies, then it is hard to compare those case numbers,” Larsen said. 
About 113,041,221 tests were administered by all BIG TEN conference schools from March to December 2020. From March to December 2020, 1,634,245 positive cases were reported by BIG TEN conference schools from March to December 2020. This means 1.46% of the tests administered came back positive, but it should be noted that University of Iowa did not publish the tests they administered.
